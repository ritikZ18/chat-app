# Chat App using Socket.io, Express, HTML/CSS/JS

This is a simple chat application that allows users to connect and chat with each other in real-time. It uses the Socket.io library to enable real-time communication between the server and clients.

## Installation

cd chat-app
```

Then, install the dependencies by running:

## Usage
